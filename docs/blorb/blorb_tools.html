NEWS (30.1.98): 1. Andrew has now written Blorblib 1.0, a suite
of C code for Blorb file handling.
<P>
2. perlBlorb now updated to 1.03, correcting the misspelling of
the IFhd chunk, and generally tidied up (with better error
messages, for instance).  One of the <I>The Spy...</I> blorb
files is also updated, to spell IFhd correctly, and so is
scanBlorb, ditto.
<P>
(29.1.98): 1. Andrew Plotkin has created a page formally
specifying
<a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/blorb/">Blorb: A Z-Machine
Resource Collection Format Standard</a>,
and is working on some generic C code to unload Blorb files, which
may prove useful to interpreter-writers.
<P>
2. Jason Penney also has a 
<a href="http://www.jczorkmid.net/V6Lib/oldindex.html">Blorb
page</A>, containing Blorb files for the four
graphical Infocom games (Zork Zero, Journey, Shogun and Arthur).
<P>
3. perlBlorb 1.02 now fixes a misunderstanding about the inclusion
of AIFF chunks, with Blorb files for <I>The Spy...</I> recreated
accordingly, and also works on Windows/DOS machines, whose Perl
implementations distinguish binary from text files.
<P>
4. scanBlorb, a minimal Blorb-file scanner, has been added below.
It's probably useful only for testing purposes.
<HR>
<A name="one"><H4>1. What is Blorb?</H4>
<P>
  Z-code story files have the ability to give instructions (to the
interpreters playing them) that pictures should be displayed, or
that sound effects should be played, but cannot themselves contain
the pictures or sounds needed.  Instead, they refer to them only
by number.  Pictures are given numbers of 1 and above (not
necessarily contiguously), sounds are given numbers of 3 and above.
<P>

  Infocom's method of supplying pictures and sounds to go with a
given story file is not at all convenient for authors today, and
cannot cope with advances in computer graphics since the late 1980s.
Thus a new method is needed.
<P>

  "Blorb" is a format, devised by Andrew Plotkin, which embeds all
needed resources for a given story into one single "blorb file".
Indeed, it can even (optionally) include the story file itself, so
that one single file can contain all the Z-code, pictures and sound
needed to enjoy the game.  The format was debated and agreed after
some debate on the Z-machine mailing list.  The most significant
decisions are that pictures are stored in PNG format and sounds in
AIFF format (for samples) or, roughly speaking, SoundTracker files
(for music).
<P>

  The Blorb format contains a number of features for fine tuning,
and thus appears to be more complex than it really is.  The full
specification (latest version 1.0, 24 January 1998) can be found
at
<A href="http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/specification/">
ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/specification</A>
or from Andrew's URL above.
<HR>

<A name="two"><H4>2. Why is it called "Blorb"?</H4>
<P>

  "Blorb" was the name of a spell in Infocom's game <I>Enchanter</I>
whose purpose was to bind objects up into magical boxes.
<HR>
<A name="three"><H4>3. What programs currently support Blorb?</H4>
<P>

  The format is new and at present no interpreters can play Blorb
files, though pressure is building.
<P>

  However, a program to create Blorb files has just been written.
It is at present a Perl script (Perl being an interpreted language
for messing about with files, popularly used with the Unix operating
system and ported to numerous others).  This will probably not be
a permanent solution, but may be of use to interpreter-writers as
a stopgap, in that it can be used to make test Blorb files.  In its
present state, the program is called "perlBlorb".
<P>
<HR>
<A name="four"><H4>4. How does perlBlorb work?</H4>
<P>

  perlBlorb is the interpreter for a very simple programming language
called "blurb".  It reads in a file of instructions (the "blurb file")
and follows these instructions to manufacture a Blorb file, gathering
together the scattered image and sound files needed.
<P>

  Along the way, it prints out a list of Inform constant definitions
which may be useful to a game designer working on the story file which
goes with the resources in question.  In particular, this means that
the designer doesn't need to work out how to number the pictures and
sounds: perlBlorb does that automatically.
<P>

  So the process looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>
      one blurb file
      picture files in PNG format   --->   one Blorb file
      sound files                          some Inform definitions
      an (optional) story file
</PRE>
<HR>
<A name="five"><H4>5. Show me an example.</H4>
<P>
<PRE>
   !  Example "blurb" file
   
   copyright "Angela M. Horns 1998"
   release 17

   palette 16 bit

   resolution 600x400

   storyfile "games/sherbet.z5"

   sound    creak  "sounds/creaking.snd"
   sound    wind   "sounds/wind.snd"

   picture  flag     "flag.png"      scale 3/1
   picture  pattern  "backdrop.png"
</PRE>
When run through perlBlorb, this produces the following output:
<PRE>
! perlBlorb 1.0 [executing on 980124 at 15:31.33]
! The blorb spell (safely protect a small object as though in a strong box).
Constant SOUND_creak = 3;
Constant SOUND_wind = 4;
Constant PICTURE_flag = 1;
Constant PICTURE_pattern = 2;
! Completed: size 45684 bytes (2 pictures, 2 sounds)
</PRE>
Note that this text can be run directly through Inform.  If so, a game
designer can then simply use assembly language like so:
<PRE>
   @sound_effect SOUND_creak 2 128 255;
</PRE>
("start playing this effect at about half maximum volume, repeating
it indefinitely").  An alternative would be to use a convenient class
library, such as "V6Lib" by Jason Penney, to avoid messing about with
assembly language.
<P>
<HR>
<A name="six"><H4>6. What if I want to
give my pictures and sounds my own numbers?</H4>
<P>
  You're free to specify the numbering yourself, and you need not
give names for the pictures and sounds.  So a blurb command like:
<PRE>
   picture "backdrop.png"
</PRE>
gives this image the next picture number (that is, the number which
is one more than the previous picture's number, or 1 if it's the
first picture in the file).  A blurb command like so:
<PRE>
   picture 100 "backdrop.png"
</PRE>
gives it picture number 100.

  The only restriction is that pictures must be given in increasing
numerical order.  (perlBlorb makes this restriction to help prevent
accidental duplication of numbers -- it isn't a restriction in the
"blorb" format itself.)  Similarly with the numbering of sounds.
<HR>

<A name="seven"><H4>7. What's the full
specification for the "blurb" language?</H4>

  With one exception (see 'palette' below) each command occupies
one and only one line of text.  Lines are permitted to be empty or
to contain only white space.  Lines whose first non-white-space
character is an exclamation mark are treated as comments, that is,
ignored.  ("White space" means spaces and tab characters.)
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>[string]<TD>means any text within double-quotes (not containing
              either double-quote or new-line characters)
<TR>
<TD>[number]<TD>a decimal number in the range 0 to 32767
<TR>
<TD>[id]<TD>either nothing at all, or a [number], or a sequence
              of up to 20 alphanumeric characters or underscores
<TR>
<TD>[dim]<TD>screen dimensions: must take the form
              [number]x[number]
<TR>
<TD>[ratio]<TD>a fraction in the form [number]/[number]
              (0/0 is legal but otherwise numbers must be positive)
<TR>
<TD>[colour]<TD>a colour expressed as six hexadecimal digits, as in
              some of Netscape's HTML tags: for instance F5DEB3
              is the colour of wheat, with red value F5 (on a
              scale 00, none, to FF, full), green value DE and
              blue value B3.  Hexadecimal digits may be given in
              either upper or lower case.
</TABLE>
With the exception of 'picture' and 'sound', each type of command
can only occur at most once in any blurb file.  Commands can be used
in any order or not at all: an empty "blurb" file results in a
perfectly legal, if useless, Blorb file.
<BR>

<BR><B>copyright [string]</B><BR>
Adds this copyright declaration to the file.  It would normally
consist of the author's name and the date.
<P>
<BR><B>release [number]</B><BR>
Gives this release number to the file.  (This is the number
returned by the opcode "@picture_data 0" within any game using
the Blorb file, and might be used when printing out version
information.)
<P>
<BR><B>palette 16 bit<BR>
palette 32 bit<BR>
palette { [colour-1] ... [colour-N] }</B><BR>
Blorb allows designers to signal to the interpreter that a
particular colour-scheme is in use.  The first two options simply
suggest that the pictures are best displayed using (at least)
16-bit, or 32-bit, colours -- no special palette is in use.
The third option specifies colours used in the pictures
in terms of red/green/blue levels, and the braces allow the
sequence of colours to continue over many lines.  At least
one and at most 256 colours may be defined in this way.  This is
only a "clue" to the interpreter -- see the Blorb specification
for details.
<P>
<BR><B>resolution [dim]<BR>
resolution [dim] min [dim]<BR>
resolution [dim] max [dim]<BR>
resolution [dim] min [dim] max [dim]</B><BR>
Allows the designer to to signal a preferred screen size, in real
pixels, in case the interpreter should have any choice over this.
The minimum and maximum values are the extreme values at which
the designer thinks the game will be playable: they're optional,
the default values being 0x0 and infinity by infinity.
<P>
<BR><B>storyfile [string]<BR>
storyfile [string] include</B><BR>
Tells perlBlorb the filename of the Z-code story file which these
resources are being provided for.  (There is no need to do this
if you prefer not to.)
Usually the Blorb file simply contains a note of the release number,
serial code and checksum of the story file, which an interpreter
can try to match at run-time to see if the Blorb file and story
file go together.  If the "include" option is used, however, the
entire story file is embedded within the Blorb file, so that game
and resources are all bound up in one single file.
<P>
<BR><B>sound [id] [string]<BR>
sound [id] [string] repeat [number]<BR>
sound [id] [string] repeat forever<BR>
sound [id] [string] music<BR>
sound [id] [string] song</B><BR>
Tells perlBlorb to take a sound sample from the named file and
make it the sound effect with the given number.  The file should
be an AIFF file unless "music" is specified, in which case it
should be a MOD file (roughly speaking a SoundTracker file); or
unless "song" is specified, in which case it should be a song
file (roughly, a SoundTracker file using other Blorb sound effects
as note samples).
<P>Note that repeat information (the number of repeats to be played)
is meaningful only in Blorb files to accompany version 3 games.
In all modern games, repetition is under the control of the game
file directly, so that this feature of Blorb is provided only to
make it possible to enBlorb the sound effects for Infocom's V3
game "The Lurking Horror".
<P>
<BR><B>picture [id] [string]<BR>
picture [id] [string] scale [ratio]<BR>
picture [id] [string] scale min [ratio]<BR>
picture [id] [string] scale [ratio] min [ratio]<BR>
...etc.</B><BR>
Similarly for pictures: the named file must be a PNG-format image.
Optionally, the designer can specify a scale factor at which the
interpreter will display the image -- or, alternatively, a range
of acceptable scale factors, from which the interpreter may choose
its own scale factor.  (The default situation is that an image is
not scaleable and an interpreter must display it pixel-for-pixel.)
<P>
There are three optional scale factors given: the preferred
scale factor, the minimum and the maximum allowed.  The minimum
and maximum each default to the preferred value if not given.
The default preferred scale factor is 1.
<P>
Scale factors are expressed as fractions: so for instance,
<PRE>
      picture "flag/png" scale 3/1
</PRE>      
means "always display triple size", whereas
<PRE>
      picture "backdrop/png" scale min 1/10 max 8/1
</PRE>      
means "you can display this anywhere between 1/10th normal size
and eight times normal size, but if possible it ought to be
just its normal size".

<A name="eight"><H4>8. Download perlBlorb.</H4>

You can download perlBlorb 1.03 from this very sentence:
<A href="perlBlorb.pl">from here</a>, to be exact.
<P>
Note that:
<P>
1. This is a Perl 5 script, though it uses few advanced features
of the language and probably works in Perl 4 equally well.
<P>
2. It has three filenames wired into it, but all occur in obvious
scalar declarations in the first few lines.  These need to be
changed to something sensible for the host machine.  The temporary
directory can be anywhere where files can harmlessly be created.
(Note that perlBlorb doesn't bother to delete these temporary
files at the end of its run.)
<P>
3. It's very rudimentary and, in particular, fails to check for
several error conditions (say, including two contradictory palette
definitions).  Caveat downloador.
<P>
You can also download scanBlorb, a rudimentary Perl script for
parsing and reporting on the contents of a Blorb file,
<A href="scanBlorb.pl">from here</a>.

<HR>

<A name="nine"><H4>9. Download an example game.</H4>

You can get one example from here: <I>THE BLORB FILE: or, The
Spy Who Came In From The Garden</I>, an audio-enhanced vignette
of espionage and disguise set in the heart of the Cotswold
countryside.  (I believe this is the first Z-machine game to
use sound effects written since 1988.)
<P>
This very short Version 5 game uses sound effects (AIFF only:
no music or song samples) but not graphics, and was written as
an easy test case.  It has only a simple Blorb file, which I hope
will enable interpreter-writers to start work on upgrading to
Blorb without the distraction of handling graphics and the
intricacies of Version 6.  The game prints text like:
<PRE>
[Sound effect 5 should be heard now.]
</PRE>
whenever it executes the <B>sound_effect</B> opcode, so it should
at least be easy to tell what is supposed to happen.  There are
five sound effects in the game.
<P>
You can download two different versions:
<P>
1. <A HREF="../test/spy1.blb">A single Blorb file</A> which has the
story file included within it.
<P>
2. The <A HREF="../test/spy.z5">story file</A> plus a separate
<A HREF="../test/spy2.blb">Blorb file</A> (which contains a chunk
identifying itself as belonging to the story file, but doesn't
include the actual Z-code).
<P>
This is all very experimental, so it's quite possible that
there's some mistake in these Blorb files -- indeed these are
the third versions already.  Please let me know if you suspect
further difficulty.
